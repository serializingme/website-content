Yet another blog about personal projects and research, thoughts and ideas. Just about anything that I'm tinkering at the moment but focusing on one of my passions, IT security.

  <p>Always fond of understanding how things worked, breaking them down and getting them back together, most of the times they wouldn't end in working condition, so I started moving away from hardware (electronics) to software. This move happened at high school, when I decided to follow an IT specific course for the three years that preceded college. I was also an avid online gamer and when in college I decided to apply my basic reverse engineering skills (previously used against basic executable packers and the likes) with the online First Person Shooter (FPS) game Unreal Tournament.</p>

Granted that at the time, the Unreal Engine was already somewhat documented (community effort), but on the other-hand, the anti-cheats systems were not. This was my first one hundred percent dedicated effort into the realm of IT security. Experience was gained into Windows internals and development, x86 assembly and the tools of the trade.

Later on, I started branching into other areas of IT security. After finishing my degree, I was focusing on Web based applications security when I took duties up as a software developer at a small consulting company. The company was small and diverse in activities, I was doing software development, middleware installation and support, and after my employers noticed my interest and skill in discovering security vulnerabilities in Web applications, I performed my first professional security assessment. After that, I got to do more security assessments and had the possibility to grow professionally in a area that I have always only been able to dedicate my free time.
