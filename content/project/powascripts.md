Collection of PowerShell scripts used for incident response, reconnaissance, etc.

<!--more-->

This project is a simple repository for all the PowerShell scripts I have develop and that can be useful to others. Most of them I use for every day tasks like incident reponse, reconnaissance, etc. They are all licensed under GPLv3 and don't have any dependency other than having PowerShell installed in the host computer. More information on the development and usage of the library can be found on the related posts and repository links bellow.
