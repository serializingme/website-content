Malware Classification is a workflow that makes use of Machine Learning (ML) to classify unknown Windows Portable Executable (PE) files.

<!--more-->

## Setup

This project is developed using [KNIME][1], a open source data analytics platform. As such, before starting to classify malware, you'll need to download and install this software in order to use the workflow.

After that, there is some more setup needed. First, the model needs to be trained and for that it needs sample. There are three directories in the workspace:

* `Data/Benign`
* `Data/Malicious`
* `Data/Unknown`

These directories should contain known benign PE files, known malicious PE files, and unknown malicious PE files respectively.

After you have acquired the benign and malicious samples needed to train the model, you need to download the [pecoff4j][2] Java library into the `Library` directory. The workspace is configured to use version `0.0.2.1`.

## Classify Samples

Just drop the PE files in the `Data/Unknown` directory and run the workflow. For the source code and more information check the link.
