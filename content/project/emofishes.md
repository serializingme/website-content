Collection of proof of concepts that help improve, bypass or detect virtualized malware execution environments.

<!--more-->

This proof of concepts iclude a common code static link library, Cufish (Curious Fish) which provides information about the execution environment that could be used pre-emptively to improve the sandbox and avoid detection by malware, and Nofish (Nosey Fish) which lists all directories and files of all the drives in a system. More information on the development and usage of the library can be found on the related posts and repository links bellow.
