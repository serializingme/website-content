{{< quote cite="Bender, Erich. Helga. Wiesbaden (Germany): Falken-Verlang, 1968" >}}The man of modern industrial society thinks, repeatedly, that he can replace the loss of intimacy through external mechanisms. This belief is reinforced by a series of activities that promise you hope and happiness, but that really only leaves you the insipid taste of an even greater disappointment.{{< /quote >}}

In a world where many strive to find instant happiness and gratification in one nighters, through Facebook likes, Twitter retweets and the ramp for limelight that YouTube views are known for, this quote from Erich F. Bender is as up to date as it was in 1968 when his book, "Helga", was published.
